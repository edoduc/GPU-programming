# GPU-programming
Labs of GPU programming

In the framewok of a GPU programming course, 2 labs notebooks:
- __<u>Matrix multiplication:</u>__ implement different methods of matrix multiplication (cpu vs gpu, basic/tiled/cublas) to compare runtime and efficiency
- __Linear classifier:__ implement a basic linear classifier (weigth initialization, prediction, gradient descent, weight update) using GPU to parallelize calculations and decrease runtime

Both labs are coded in C
